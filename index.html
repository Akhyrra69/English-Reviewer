    <h3>1. Context Clues</h3>
    <p>
        Context clues are essential tools that help readers infer the meaning of unfamiliar words based on the surrounding text. When you encounter an unknown word, looking at the sentence or paragraph can provide hints about its meaning. Context clues can be based on the definition, synonym, antonym, or examples given in the text. They allow readers to understand new vocabulary without having to look up every word.
        <br><br>
        Example: "The mountain was so steep, it was almost impossible to climb. The hikers struggled to get to the top." Here, the word "steep" refers to a sharp incline, which can be inferred from the context of the hikers struggling to climb it.
    </p>

    <div id="learn-more-context-clues" class="learn-more-content">
        <h4>Types of Context Clues:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition Clue:</strong> The meaning of the unfamiliar word is directly explained in the sentence or passage. For example, "The boy was jubilant, which means he was filled with great joy."</li>
            <li><strong>Synonym Clue:</strong> A synonym or a word with a similar meaning is used nearby. For example, "She was feeling miserable, her mood was quite low." The word "miserable" is explained by the synonym "low mood."</li>
            <li><strong>Antonym Clue:</strong> The opposite meaning is provided to give context. For example, "He was unlike his brother, who was always gregarious. He was very introverted." Here, the word "introverted" is clarified by the antonym "gregarious."</li>
            <li><strong>Example Clue:</strong> Specific examples are given to explain the unfamiliar word. For example, "The zoo had many exotic animals, such as tigers, lions, and zebras." The word "exotic" can be inferred as referring to rare or unusual animals.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Strategies for Finding Context Clues:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay attention to the sentence structure around the unfamiliar word.</li>
            <li>Look for words that explain or redefine the difficult word.</li>
            <li>Read before and after the word for additional context that can help you guess its meaning.</li>
            <li>Use punctuation, like commas or dashes, to understand how the word fits into the sentence.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>2. Use Context Clues to Find the Meaning of Unfamiliar Words</h3>
    <p>
        Using context clues is a powerful skill for understanding new vocabulary. When encountering an unfamiliar word, always check the surrounding text for hints. This can include the overall tone of the passage, the words used before or after the unfamiliar word, and any explanations or comparisons provided.
        <br><br>
        Example: "The forest was eerily quiet, and the only sounds were the distant chirps of birds. The atmosphere felt oppressive, as if something was lurking in the shadows." The word "oppressive" refers to something heavy or overwhelming, and you can infer this meaning from the surrounding description of the quiet and foreboding atmosphere.

        <h4>How to Use Context Clues:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Look for Definitions:</strong> Some authors will directly define the unfamiliar word within the sentence, making it easy to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>Find Synonyms:</strong> If a word has a synonym in the nearby text, it can be a helpful clue. For example, "Her laughter was uproarious, filled with joyful noise."</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze the Mood:</strong> The mood or tone of the text can offer significant clues. Words like "dreary," "gloomy," or "cheerful" give you insights into the overall feeling of the passage.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Surrounding Words:</strong> Words that come before or after an unfamiliar word can help you figure out its meaning. For example, "The professor was known for his pedantic manner, often focusing on irrelevant details." Here, "pedantic" can be inferred as overly concerned with minor details.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Examples of Using Context Clues:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sentence: "The librarian, always so meticulous, checked each book thoroughly before shelving it." The word "meticulous" means careful and precise.</li>
            <li>Sentence: "She was feeling nostalgic, as she fondly remembered her childhood home." The word "nostalgic" means a longing or fondness for the past.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>3. Use Clear and Coherent Sentences Employing Appropriate Grammatical Structures</h3>
    <p>
        Clear and coherent sentences are the foundation of effective communication. To write or speak well, it is crucial to use grammatically correct structures that convey your message without confusion. Each sentence should have a subject (the doer of the action), a verb (the action), and a complement or object (what is acted upon). Additionally, appropriate punctuation is necessary for clarity.
        <br><br>
        Example: "The dog chased the ball across the yard." This sentence follows a simple subject-verb-object structure, which is clear and easy to understand. "The dog" is the subject, "chased" is the verb, and "the ball" is the object.
    </p>

    <div id="learn-more-coherent-sentences" class="learn-more-content">
        <h4>Building Coherent Sentences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Simple Sentences First:</strong> Begin with simple, short sentences and gradually move to more complex ones. For example, "She smiled." followed by "She smiled as she walked through the door."</li>
            <li><strong>Use Proper Sentence Structures:</strong> Ensure each sentence has a subject, a verb, and a clear object. For example, "The cat sat on the mat" is structured correctly with a subject ("the cat"), a verb ("sat"), and an object ("on the mat").</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Run-on Sentences:</strong> Run-on sentences occur when two independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions. Break long sentences into shorter ones to improve clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Concise:</strong> Avoid unnecessary words that do not contribute to the sentence's meaning. For example, "The book is on the table." is clear, while "The book that is on the table is the one I wanted" could be more concise.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Examples of Coherent Sentences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>"The children played in the park until sunset."</li>
            <li>"She loves reading books in the quiet of the evening."</li>
            <li>"After school, I went to the store and bought some apples."</li>

<div class="topic">
    <h3>4. Kinds of Nouns: Mass Nouns, Count Nouns, Possessive Nouns, and Collective Nouns</h3>
    <p>
        Nouns are essential in language because they represent people, places, things, or ideas. Nouns can be categorized into various types based on their usage and properties. Understanding these categories helps improve writing and speaking by using the right noun in the appropriate context.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Mass Nouns</strong> refer to things that cannot be counted individually. These are often abstract or refer to substances or concepts. For example, "water," "sand," and "air" cannot be counted individually without units like liters or grains. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Count Nouns</strong> are those that can be counted and have both singular and plural forms. Examples include "apple," "dog," and "car." These can be counted as one, two, three, etc.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Possessive Nouns</strong> show ownership or possession. These nouns often have an apostrophe to indicate possession, such as "Tom's car" or "The dog's leash."
        <br><br>
        <strong>Collective Nouns</strong> refer to a group of things or people. For example, "family," "team," and "class" are collective nouns because they represent groups of individuals or things.

            <li><strong>Mass Noun:</strong> "I need some flour to bake the cake." (Flour cannot be counted directly.)</li>
            <li><strong>Count Noun:</strong> "There are seven books on the shelf." (Books can be counted.)</li>
            <li><strong>Possessive Noun:</strong> "Emily's dog is very friendly." (The dog belongs to Emily.)</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Noun:</strong> "The committee reached a decision after a long discussion." (The committee is a group of people working together.)</li>

<!-- Topic 5: Use of Personal Pronouns in Sentences -->
<div class="topic">
    <h3>5. Use of Personal Pronouns in Sentences</h3>
    <p>
        Personal pronouns are words used to replace nouns, usually to avoid repetition or to simplify sentences. They can represent people, things, or animals and are essential in writing and speaking for maintaining sentence flow.
        <br><br>
        Example: "John went to the store. He bought some bread." The pronoun "He" replaces "John," helping avoid redundancy. 
        <br><br>
        Personal pronouns change based on the subject or object of the sentence and the formality of the situation.

        <h4>Types of Personal Pronouns:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject Pronouns:</strong> These replace the subject of the sentence. Examples: "I," "you," "he," "she," "it," "we," "they."</li>
            <li><strong>Object Pronouns:</strong> These replace the object of the sentence. Examples: "me," "you," "him," "her," "it," "us," "them."</li>
            <li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> These indicate ownership. Examples: "mine," "yours," "his," "hers," "ours," "theirs."</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Examples in Sentences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Subject: "She is going to the store."</li>
            <li>Object: "He saw them at the concert."</li>
